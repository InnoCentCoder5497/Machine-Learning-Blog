# Linear Regression

Regression is a method of modelling a target value based on independent predictors. This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out cause and effect relationship between variables. Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable.

In Linear Regression we try to find a line that `best fits` our dataset. This means that we want a line segment that cuts most of the data points in our dataset. Below is how a linear regression learn the line segment to fit a toy dataset.

The <b>Disadvantage</b> of Linear regression is that it only works when data is `linear` as in above case. For non-linear datasets it's , not the best algorithm to use but is a very useful startng point to understand linearity of your dataset.
